Key Points
==========

 * Understanding system resources necessary to build and run a workload
   is important.
 * Linux tracing and strace can be used to discover the system resources
   in use by a workload. The completeness of the system usage information
   depends on the completeness of coverage of a workload.
 * Performance and security of the operating system can be analyzed with
   the help of tools such as:
   `perf <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/perf.1.html>`_,
   `stress-ng <https://www.mankier.com/1/stress-ng>`_,
   `paxtest <https://github.com/opntr/paxtest-freebsd>`_.
 * Once we discover and understand the workload needs, we can focus on them
   to avoid regressions and use it to evaluate safety considerations.

Methodology
===========

`strace <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html>`_ is a
diagnostic, instructional, and debugging tool and can be used to discover
the system resources in use by a workload. Once we discover and understand
the workload needs, we can focus on them to avoid regressions and use it
to evaluate safety considerations. We use strace tool to trace workloads.

This method of tracing using strace tells us the system calls invoked by
the workload and doesn't include all the system calls that can be invoked
by it. It reports syscall arguments and results, not the internal kernel
code paths. As an example, if a workload opens a file and reads from it
successfully, that run does not exercise the error cases for those calls.
The completeness of the system usage information depends on the completeness
of coverage of a workload.

The goal is tracing a workload on a system running a default kernel without
requiring custom kernel installs.

How do we gather fine-grained system information?
=================================================

strace tool can be used to trace system calls made by a process and signals
it receives. System calls are the fundamental interface between an
application and the operating system kernel. They enable a program to
request services from the kernel. For instance, the open() system call in
Linux is used to provide access to a file in the file system. strace enables
us to track all the system calls made by an application. It lists all the
system calls made by a process and their resulting output.

You can generate profiling data combining strace and perf record tools to
record the events and information associated with a process. This provides
insight into the process. "perf annotate" tool generates the statistics of
each instruction of the program. This document goes over the details of how
to gather fine-grained information on a workload's usage of system resources.

We used strace to trace the perf, stress-ng, paxtest workloads to illustrate
our methodology to discover resources used by a workload. This process can
be applied to trace other workloads.

Getting the system ready for tracing
====================================

Before we can get started we will show you how to get your system ready.
We assume that you have a Linux distribution running on a physical system
or a virtual machine. Most distributions will include strace command. Let’s
install other tools that aren’t usually included to build Linux kernel.
Please note that the following works on Debian based distributions. You
might have to find equivalent packages on other Linux distributions.

Install tools to build Linux kernel and tools in kernel repository.
scripts/ver_linux is a good way to check if your system already has
the necessary tools::

  sudo apt-get install build-essential flex bison yacc
  sudo apt install libelf-dev systemtap-sdt-dev libslang2-dev libperl-dev libdw-dev

cscope is a good tool to browse kernel sources. Let's install it now::

  sudo apt-get install cscope

Install stress-ng and paxtest::

  apt-get install stress-ng
  apt-get install paxtest

Workload overview
=================

As mentioned earlier, we used strace to trace perf bench, stress-ng and
paxtest workloads to show how to analyze a workload and identify Linux
subsystems used by these workloads. Let's start with an overview of these
three workloads to get a better understanding of what they do and how to
use them.

perf bench (all) workload
-------------------------

The perf bench command contains multiple multi-threaded microkernel
benchmarks for executing different subsystems in the Linux kernel and
system calls. This allows us to easily measure the impact of changes,
which can help mitigate performance regressions. It also acts as a common
benchmarking framework, enabling developers to easily create test cases,
integrate transparently, and use performance-rich tooling subsystems.

Stress-ng netdev stressor workload
----------------------------------

stress-ng is used for performing stress testing on the kernel. It allows
you to exercise various physical subsystems of the computer, as well as
interfaces of the OS kernel, using "stressor-s". They are available for
CPU, CPU cache, devices, I/O, interrupts, file system, memory, network,
operating system, pipelines, schedulers, and virtual machines. Please refer
to the `stress-ng man-page <https://www.mankier.com/1/stress-ng>`_ to
find the description of all the available stressor-s. The netdev stressor
starts specified number (N) of workers that exercise various netdevice
ioctl commands across all the available network devices.

paxtest kiddie workload
-----------------------

paxtest is a program that tests buffer overflows in the kernel. It tests
kernel enforcements over memory usage. Generally, execution in some memory
segments makes buffer overflows possible. It runs a set of programs that
attempt to subvert memory usage. It is used as a regression test suite for
PaX, but might be useful to test other memory protection patches for the
kernel. We used paxtest kiddie mode which looks for simple vulnerabilities.

What is strace and how do we use it?
====================================

As mentioned earlier, strace which is a useful diagnostic, instructional,
and debugging tool and can be used to discover the system resources in use
by a workload. It can be used:

 * To see how a process interacts with the kernel.
 * To see why a process is failing or hanging.
 * For reverse engineering a process.
 * To find the files on which a program depends.
 * For analyzing the performance of an application.
 * For troubleshooting various problems related to the operating system.

In addition, strace can generate run-time statistics on times, calls, and
errors for each system call and report a summary when program exits,
suppressing the regular output. This attempts to show system time (CPU time
spent running in the kernel) independent of wall clock time. We plan to use
these features to get information on workload system usage.

strace command supports basic, verbose, and stats modes. strace command when
run in verbose mode gives more detailed information about the system calls
invoked by a process.

Running strace -c generates a report of the percentage of time spent in each
system call, the total time in seconds, the microseconds per call, the total
number of calls, the count of each system call that has failed with an error
and the type of system call made.

 * Usage: strace <command we want to trace>
 * Verbose mode usage: strace -v <command>
 * Gather statistics: strace -c <command>

We used the “-c” option to gather fine-grained run-time statistics in use
by three workloads we have chose for this analysis.

 * perf
 * stress-ng
 * paxtest

To retain arguments, results, and calls from child processes, run the
application with its normal inputs and environment::

    strace -f -o syscalls.log ./app
    strace -f -c -o syscall-summary.txt ./app

These are separate runs. ``-f`` follows children and threads; ``-c`` produces
a summary rather than the chronological trace. For a narrower investigation,
add ``-e trace=%file`` to the first command to select file-related calls.
``-k`` can add user-space stack traces when strace supports unwinding; it
does not expose the kernel call stack. For an application that does not exit,
stop the tracing session after a defined observation interval. Include
startup and representative error inputs, not just a successful steady state.

What is cscope and how do we use it?
====================================

Now let’s look at `cscope <https://cscope.sourceforge.net/>`_, a command
line tool for browsing C, C++ or Java code-bases. We can use it to find
all the references to a symbol, global definitions, functions called by a
function, functions calling a function, text strings, regular expression
patterns, files including a file.

We can use cscope to find which system call belongs to which subsystem.
This way we can find the kernel subsystems used by a process when it is
executed.

Let’s checkout the latest Linux repository and build cscope database::

  git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git linux
  cd linux
  cscope -R -p10  # builds cscope.out database before starting browse session
  cscope -d -p10  # starts browse session on cscope.out database

Note: Run "cscope -R -p10" to build the database and "cscope -d -p10" to
enter into the browsing session. cscope by default uses the cscope.out
database. To get out of this mode press ctrl+d. -p option is used to
specify the number of file path components to display. -p10 is optimal
for browsing kernel sources.

Alternatively, the kernel build system can generate the cscope database::

  make cscope

To exclude directories from the generated database, pass IGNORE_DIRS to
the cscope target. For example, to exclude Documentation/, run::

  make IGNORE_DIRS="Documentation" cscope

What is perf and how do we use it?
==================================

Perf is an analysis tool based on Linux 2.6+ systems, which abstracts the
CPU hardware difference in performance measurement in Linux, and provides
a simple command line interface. Perf is based on the perf_events interface
exported by the kernel. It is very useful for profiling the system and
finding performance bottlenecks in an application.

If you haven't already checked out the Linux mainline repository, you can do
so and then build kernel and perf tool::

  git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git linux
  cd linux
  make -j3 all
  cd tools/perf
  make

Note: The perf command can be built without building the kernel in the
repository and can be run on older kernels. However matching the kernel
and perf revisions gives more accurate information on the subsystem usage.

We used "perf stat" and "perf bench" options. For a detailed information on
the perf tool, run "perf -h".

perf stat
---------
The perf stat command generates a report of various hardware and software
events. It does so with the help of hardware counter registers found in
modern CPUs that keep the count of these activities. "perf stat cal" shows
stats for cal command.

Perf bench
----------
The perf bench command contains multiple multi-threaded microkernel
benchmarks for executing different subsystems in the Linux kernel and
system calls. This allows us to easily measure the impact of changes,
which can help mitigate performance regressions. It also acts as a common
benchmarking framework, enabling developers to easily create test cases,
integrate transparently, and use performance-rich tooling.

"perf bench all" runs all available benchmarks in the perf bench
framework. The exact set of benchmarks depends on the perf version and on
the features enabled when perf was built.

To list the benchmark collections available on the current system, run::

  perf bench

To list benchmarks in a collection, run::

  perf bench <collection>

For example, to list the benchmarks in the mem collection, run::

  perf bench mem

What is stress-ng and how do we use it?
=======================================

As mentioned earlier, stress-ng is used for performing stress testing on
the kernel. It allows you to exercise various physical subsystems of the
computer, as well as interfaces of the OS kernel, using stressor-s. They
are available for CPU, CPU cache, devices, I/O, interrupts, file system,
memory, network, operating system, pipelines, schedulers, and virtual
machines.

The netdev stressor starts N workers that exercise various netdevice ioctl
commands across all the available network devices. The following ioctls are
exercised:

 * SIOCGIFCONF, SIOCGIFINDEX, SIOCGIFNAME, SIOCGIFFLAGS
 * SIOCGIFADDR, SIOCGIFNETMASK, SIOCGIFMETRIC, SIOCGIFMTU
 * SIOCGIFHWADDR, SIOCGIFMAP, SIOCGIFTXQLEN

The following command runs the stressor::

  stress-ng --netdev 1 -t 60 --metrics

We can use the perf record command to record the events and information
associated with a process. This command records the profiling data in the
perf.data file in the same directory.

Using the following commands you can record the events associated with the
netdev stressor, view the generated report perf.data and annotate the output
to view the statistics of each instruction of the program::

  perf record -- stress-ng --netdev 1 -t 60 --metrics
  perf report
  perf annotate

What is paxtest and how do we use it?
=====================================

paxtest is a program that tests buffer overflows in the kernel. It tests
kernel enforcements over memory usage. Generally, execution in some memory
segments makes buffer overflows possible. It runs a set of programs that
attempt to subvert memory usage. It is used as a regression test suite for
PaX, and will be useful to test other memory protection patches for the
kernel.

paxtest provides kiddie and blackhat modes. The paxtest kiddie mode runs
in normal mode, whereas the blackhat mode tries to get around the protection
of the kernel testing for vulnerabilities. We focus on the kiddie mode here
and combine "paxtest kiddie" run with "perf record" to collect CPU stack
traces for the paxtest kiddie run to see which function is calling other
functions in the performance profile. Then the "dwarf" (DWARF's Call Frame
Information) mode can be used to unwind the stack.

The following command can be used to view resulting report in call-graph
format::

  perf record --call-graph dwarf paxtest kiddie
  perf report --stdio

Tracing workloads
=================

Now that we understand the workloads, let's start tracing them.

Tracing perf bench all workload
-------------------------------

Run the following command to trace perf bench all workload::

 strace -c perf bench all

Kernel paths reached by the workload
====================================

To go beyond the syscall boundary, use the function graph tracer described
in :doc:`/trace/ftrace`. In a tracing-capable test system or QEMU guest,
install ``trace-cmd`` and check that the running kernel provides
``CONFIG_FTRACE``, ``CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER``, and
``CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER``. Enabling ``FTRACE`` alone is not sufficient.
Check availability and collect a task-filtered graph::

    trace-cmd list -t
    sudo trace-cmd record -p function_graph -F -c -O nofuncgraph-irqs \
        --user "$USER" -o functions.dat ./app
    trace-cmd report -i functions.dat > functions.txt

Use an isolated measurement system: these commands change its tracing state.
``-F`` filters to the launched application, ``-c`` follows its children, and
``--user`` avoids running the workload as root just because the recorder needs
privileges. Preserve the workload's original user and environment. The option
``nofuncgraph-irqs`` excludes interrupt execution from the graph; asynchronous
work in other tasks is outside this task filter too. Check the report for lost
events before treating missing functions as unobserved. The perf examples
above provide sampled profiles, not an exhaustive list of executed functions.

Tracing a minimal user space
============================

A single-binary initramfs has no shell or guest tracing tools. Initial discovery
can use the same application and libc in a full guest for the target
architecture, but that does not reproduce its launch as PID 1. Inspect the
actual boot with QEMU's host-side GDB stub without adding tools to the archive.

Follow :doc:`/process/debugging/gdb-kernel-debugging` for the debug build and
matching ``vmlinux`` setup. Add ``nokaslr`` to the guest kernel command line
and ``-S -gdb tcp:127.0.0.1:1234`` to the QEMU boot command. ``-S`` pauses the
guest before boot, allowing breakpoints to be installed. Connect host GDB::

    gdb-multiarch /path/to/build/vmlinux
    (gdb) target remote localhost:1234
    (gdb) tbreak kernel_init
    (gdb) continue

For a native 64-bit arm64 workload, the following records syscall entry numbers
and the first argument from the saved user registers. It starts after PID 1's
kernel initialization, before the application executes::

    (gdb) set pagination off
    (gdb) set logging file pid1-syscalls.log
    (gdb) set logging enabled on
    (gdb) break do_el0_svc
    (gdb) commands
    > silent
    > printf "syscall=%lu arg0=%#lx\n", regs->regs[8], regs->regs[0]
    > continue
    > end
    (gdb) continue

Interrupt GDB with Ctrl-C after the observation interval, then disable logging.
Resolve the numbers using the matching target build's syscall-number definitions.
These are entry observations, not decoded arguments or syscall results. To
inspect a particular kernel path, disable the logging breakpoint, set a
breakpoint on its implementation, and use ``bt`` or ``step`` at the hit.
Entry functions and register layouts are architecture- and revision-specific;
check them against the matching source. Once other processes exist, an entry
breakpoint can also capture their calls; GDB threads in QEMU represent vCPUs,
not Linux tasks. This is not a task-filtered whole-kernel coverage collector.

QEMU also offers low-level logging with ``-d`` (list options with ``-d help``)
and ``-D qemu.log``. For example, ``-d in_asm`` logs translated instruction
blocks, not every execution or a workload-specific call trace. Do not use its
absence of a repeated block as evidence that the block did not execute.

Mapping observations to configuration
-------------------------------------

Use the source revision and architecture matching the measured kernel, rather
than assuming the syscall tables above describe every build. Locate each
syscall implementation with cscope or its ``SYSCALL_DEFINE`` declaration,
follow calls into the relevant subsystem, and inspect its Makefile and Kconfig.
For example, ``eventfd2`` is implemented in ``fs/eventfd.c``;
``fs/Makefile`` builds ``eventfd.o`` under ``CONFIG_EVENTFD``. Use the
configuration help to review its dependencies before changing the option.
Other paths, such as the core ``write`` syscall, are built unconditionally
and may reach different drivers depending on the file descriptor. A syscall
does not necessarily map to one removable option.

Retain results as well as names: a libc may probe an optional syscall, tolerate
``ENOSYS``, and take a fallback path. Observing the call alone does not prove
that the feature must remain enabled. Conversely, boot and recovery dependencies
may be absent from an application's syscall trace. Record the observed path,
source/configuration mapping, and result of re-testing after the change.

For the distinction between built code and observed execution, use
:doc:`/dev-tools/gcov` for execution counts and :doc:`/dev-tools/kcov` for
task-scoped kernel PCs. Follow their collection and symbolization instructions
in a separate measurement build; neither strace nor a sampled perf profile
supplies those coverage results. Unobserved code remains a candidate for
investigation, not proof of an unnecessary feature.

Keep the built-code inventory alongside the runtime observations using
``scripts/kernel-sloc --report compiled.json kernel .`` and, for the matching
debug ELF, ``scripts/kernel-sloc --report linked.json dwarf vmlinux``. See
:doc:`kernel-minimization` ("Counting kernel SLOC") for setup and scope. The
reports list compiled files and DWARF-resolved functions/source lines, not
execution. Compare full source paths as well as function names; repeated
static names and inlining make names alone insufficient. An unobserved entry
is a review candidate, not proof that its configuration can be removed.
